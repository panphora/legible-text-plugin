# Image brightness / luminosity normalizer for text over image

In a work project, the UI guys had defined large parts of the interface as text over image. To improve legibility, I experimented with ways to automatically darken an image based on its original brightness.

You can hover over an image to view it without the overlay, and see the percentage brightness found by the calculation.
